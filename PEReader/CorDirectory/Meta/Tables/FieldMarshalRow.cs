	/// It "links" an existing row in the Field or Param table,

	/// (which, as usual, covers the method return, as parameter number 0)
	/// shall be marshalled when calling to or from unmanaged code via PInvoke dispatch.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Note that FieldMarshal information is used only by code paths that arbitrate operation with unmanaged code.
	/// In order to execute such paths, the caller, on most platforms, would be installed with elevated security permission.
	/// Once it invokes unmanaged code, it lies outside the regime that the CLI can check - it is simply trusted not to violate the type system.
